# Breakaway Tours - Operations & MIS Dashboard ✈️

## 📌 Project Overview
As the **Co-Founder & Operations Manager** of Breakaway Tours, I developed this MIS system to manage end-to-end travel operations. This project serves as the central nervous system for tracking bookings, managing vendor payments, and analyzing profit margins for group travel across India and Nepal.

## 📊 Key Features
* **Operational Tracking:** Monitors scheduling, customer communication, and service fulfillment workflows.
* **Financial Control:** Tracks operational metrics, costs, margins, and cash flow per trip.
* **Vendor Management:** Database for coordinating with hotels and transport providers to negotiate competitive rates.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Advanced Excel:** Pivot Tables for data analysis and dashboard visualization.
* **VBA Macros:** Used for automating repetitive booking tasks (simulated).
* **Logistics Planning:** Route optimization models for itineraries.

## 📈 Impact
* **Cost Reduction:** Analyzed vendor data to negotiate better rates, improving margins.
* **Efficiency:** Reduced manual errors and turnaround time by implementing standardized booking workflows.
